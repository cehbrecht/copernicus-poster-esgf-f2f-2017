%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   Tracks of features through scenes are needed for data analysis, as well as
   for movie special effects. Tracks are found in an interactive process. The
     artist marks a position, and the computer proposes a track which is then
     further refined by the artist.

   This is a difficult problem due to three aspects.
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
      \item Appearance changes due to lighting and pose
      \item Occlusions
      \item Speed: Interactive editing requires faster than framerate calculation

   We formulated tracking as path search in a large graph, and solve it
   efficiently with a modificiation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

   The method is based on \cite{awf:tracking}. Our main contributions are
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
   \item Efficient incorporation of a background appearance model
   \item Formulation as a shortest path problem
   \item (Correct) handling of occlusions
   \item High-Efficiency implementation with up to 150 fps for a high
   resolution video

    We incorporated a background model, where a click informs us not only that `this is how the
    patch looks like', but also for the rest of the frame, `this is how the patch
    does not look like'.

    Can we also \emph{efficiently} use a background tracks model, allowing us
    to reason, `this would be a good track, but part of it can be better
    explained by tracking another point'.

  \indent The cost is interpreted as a directed acyclic graph
  with weights on the nodes and edges. The nodes encode candidate positions,
  and the edges the transition costs between candidates. Additional edges
  (dashed) allow occlusion transitions which skip frames.

  The optimal track is found with a modification of Dijkstra's shortest path
  search. The search was speed up by lower bounding the cost, and lazily
  evaluating the accurate cost only where necessary to find the global optimum.
