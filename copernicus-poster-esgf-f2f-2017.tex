%%% Now define the boxes that make up the poster
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be in between, you
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle
%%% box.
