%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position

%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle
%%% box.

    Climate Projections for the Climate Data Store (CP4CDS).
    The Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) will interact with remote data and compute services,
    amongst which will be those providing global climate projections.
    An Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node and concomitant compute services
    providing access to a coherent collection of quality assured climate projections.
    CP4CDS will be delivered by a consortium of three of the leading European institutes
