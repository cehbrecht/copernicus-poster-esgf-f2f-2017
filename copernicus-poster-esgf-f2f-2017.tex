   % providing access to a coherent collection of quality assured climate projections.

   % CP4CDS will be delivered by a consortium of three of the leading European institutes

   % deliver the required data and compute services in a flexible and scalable environment with,
   % by the end of the project, high standards of reliability and performance

   % The CP4CDS system will be based on a geographically distributed highly available set of data and compute services.
   % Data will be available at CEDA, IPSL, and DKRZ, with replicas synchronised using the Synda software package.

   % A Software Dependency Deployment Solution (SDDS) consisting of code and library repositories
   % with continuous integration and a release cycle
   % to support the development of codes which exploit the data and compute interfaces offered by CP4CDS;

   % A hosted compute service with direct access on the local file system to the entire ESGF cache

   % A software toolbox to be used by those developing codes for interfacing to CP4CDS,
   % including the esgf_pyclient python library for searching ESGF for data and the
   % Synda python library for managing data movement and processing.

   % An extended ESGF sub-system populated and configured to support the Copernicus Data Store
